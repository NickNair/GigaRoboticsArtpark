This repository contains ROS nodes and messages necessary to simulate a turbulent
plume, which is an implementation of the algorithm described in [1]. This repository
is complementary to the [Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Simulator (UUV Simulator)](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator),
an open-source project extending the simulation capabilities of the robotics
simulator Gazebo to underwater vehicles and environments. For installation and
usage instructions, please refer to the [documentation pages](https://uuvsimulator.github.io/).

## Purpose of the project

This software is a research prototype, originally developed for the EU ECSEL
Project 662107 [SWARMs](http://swarms.eu/).

The software is not ready for production use. However, the license conditions of the
applicable Open Source licenses allow you to adapt the software to your needs.
Before using it in a safety relevant setting, make sure that the software
fulfills your requirements and adjust it according to any applicable safety
standards (e.g. ISO 26262).

## Requirements

To simulate the plume, please refer to the [UUV Simulator](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator)
repository and follow the installation instructions of the package. Then you can clone
this package in the `src` folder of you catkin workspace

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_plume_simulator.git
```

and then build your catkin workspace

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make # or <catkin build>, if you are using catkin_tools
```

## Example of usage

The plume simulator package are installed, one demonstration can be run to
visualize the plume particles in RViz. To start it, run

```
roslaunch uuv_plume_simulator start_plume_example.launch
```

To start an example of a turbulent plume model, run the script

```
roslaunch uuv_plume_simulator start_demo_turbulent_plume.launch
```

In this case, the plume runs independently from the [UUV Simulator](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator).
In order to start this example using one of the Gazebo worlds from UUV Simulator and
therefore use the current velocity topic generated by [a Gazebo plugin](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator/blob/master/uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_ros_plugins/include/uuv_world_ros_plugins/UnderwaterCurrentROSPlugin.hh),
start the example first as

```
roslaunch uuv_plume_simulator start_plume_example.launch use_gazebo:=true
```

and then

```
roslaunch uuv_plume_simulator start_demo_turbulent_plume.launch use_gazebo:=true
```

If no current topic is available, the particles will accumulate
around the plume source.

To add a particle concentration sensor to the vehicle, check the URDF macro snippets
found [here](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator/blob/master/uuv_sensor_plugins/uuv_sensor_plugins_ros/urdf/chemical_concentration.xacro)
that can be used to add one to the robot description.
